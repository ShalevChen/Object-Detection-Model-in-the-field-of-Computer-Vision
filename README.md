# Project Summary
This project focuses on building an Object Detection model in the field of Computer Vision. Using state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, the project aims to accurately detect and classify objects in both images and videos. The models utilized are YOLOv5s and YOLOv8m, renowned for their efficiency and accuracy in real-time object detection tasks.

# Technologies and Libraries

Technologies:
1.Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the object detection models.
2.YOLO Models: Specifically, YOLOv5s and YOLOv8m, are utilized for object detection tasks.
3.OpenCV: Used for handling image and video processing tasks.
4.Pandas and Numpy: Essential libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.

Libraries:
1.Ultralytics YOLO: A comprehensive library that provides the YOLO models and utilities for easy implementation.
2.Matplotlib: Used for plotting and visualizing the detection results.
3.PIL (Python Imaging Library): Utilized for image handling and processing.
4.Google Colab: For facilitating easy file uploads and interactions in the cloud environment.
5.Kaggle: Used to download the dataset for training and testing the model.

# Project Features

Image Detection:
The project allows users to upload an image file and perform object detection on it. The YOLO model processes the image, detects various objects, and outputs the image with bounding boxes and labels indicating the detected objects along with their probabilities.

Video Detection:
Similarly, users can upload a video file to the project. The YOLO model processes each frame of the video to detect and classify objects. The output is a video file with bounding boxes and labels on detected objects in each frame.


# Conclusion
This project demonstrates a powerful application of object detection in images and videos using YOLO models. By leveraging Python and essential libraries such as OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Ultralytics YOLO, the project achieves real-time object detection with high accuracy. Users can interact with the project by uploading their own images and videos, providing a hands-on experience of modern computer vision techniques.
